## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I am passionate about creating applications which solve problems that will impact users on a personal, meaningful level.
There are many journaling, mood tracking, and mindfullness apps out there. I myself have used several. What makes my
idea different is that the user will have access to all three features in one application. Specifically, people would
use the app daily to track their moods, thoughts, etc. That information would then be used to suggest a meditation or
mindfullness practice. When users create a profile, that information will be stored in their account and they will be able
to review their moods over a period of time as well as meditations they have completed and other related statistics (minutes spent medi-
tating, number of days with consecutive meditaiton, etc). Users with a profile can save meditations by adding them to a "favorites" list. 
The application offers a comprehensive solution for people who want to become more mindfull but do not know where to start. Once
he user becomes more acquainted with the practice of mindfullness, the app will continue to be helpful by providing access to 
saved meditations and long term data on the users' mood/meditation habits over time.
### Features
User authentication: Users will be able to create an account and login to the applicaiton.
Select mood: Users can select a mood from a list and save that information for a certain day.
			 Users can also add custom moods to make the application more personally relevant.
Record journal entry: Users will have the option to create and record a journal entry for a certain day.
Recommend meditation: After the user enters their mood and optional journal entry, a meditation will be suggested
                      based on the users' data.
Browse meditations: Users will have the option to browse a list of all meditaions offered on the app. The user can
					list meditations by category, length, etc.
### Technologies
C#/.NET, MVC Framework (w/ Razor View Pages)
HTML5/CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript
SQL Server, EntityFrameworkCore
### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn how to play media as well as use a public API or database with free to use meditations. If I
cannot find that, I will need to figure out a way to create my own database of meditations. I might also decide to 
incorporate JavaScript in my views which I will need to learn.
